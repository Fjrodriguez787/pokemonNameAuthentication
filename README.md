#How its Made

ejs, JavaScript, CSS, MONGO db, Mlab(for the DataBase), Express, Node, Passport

The Objective with this project is to have a full-stack fan site where people can change the name of the pokemon, like and dislike comments others post, and delete comments. In order to get this up and running I needed to host my own server and use an ejs file in place of my HTML. Following CRUD, this project can Create, Read, Update, and Delete. This application differs from the "simple-express" app because there is a user authentication with email sign up and logins. This fixes the issue of anonymous posts being made.

##If I had more time

If I had more time I would like to learn more about how passport works, in order to make sure I always have the best login, sign up methods and secure full-stack application

###Lesson Learned
In this application, there are more folders and programs running at once, so organization is key. I found that having a template file you can adjust code in helps keep the mistakes and breaks in code minimal.

I learned to make small changes to my code at a time and really getting in the habit of checking what changes my code is causing. It is harder to backtrack from a broken code, when you make 10 changes at a time.
